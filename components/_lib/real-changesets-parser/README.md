This is manually copied from https://github.com/tordans/real-changesets-parser/blob/master/build/index.js because I don't know how to do this propery.
Having it in package.json as `"real-changesets-parser": "github:tordans/real-changesets-parser",` will cause build erros with the \*.ts files that are part of the github repoâ€¦
